 * @brief This is the symbol table that delta will use.
 *
 * @details
 *  This is the definition of the symbol table that delta will use through all
 *  of its compilation phases. It will allow delta to keep track, at each time
 *  point, of the currently active identifiers, as well as all of their
 *  attributes.
 *
 *  As of now, it does not support scoping, as it assumes that all source code
 *  can be found in the same block.
 *
 *  The symbol table is internally represented by a single hash table, as
 *  there is no scoping at the moment. Specifically, the "uthash" library by
 *  Troy D. Hanson is the one who provides the whole hash table functionality.
 *
 *  It is also worth noting that, once the symbol table is created, its
 *  initial contents are the keywords in common/keywords.h, which need to be
 *  present in order to tell them apart from the source code's identifiers.
