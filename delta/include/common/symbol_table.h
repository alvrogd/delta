 * @brief This is the symbol table that delta will use.
 *
 * @details
 *  This is the definition of the symbol table that delta will use through all
 *  of its interpretation phases. It will allow delta to keep track, at each
 *  time point, of the currently active identifiers, math functions and built-
 *  in commands, as well as all of their attributes.
 *
 *  The symbol table is internally represented by a single hash table, as
 *  there is no scoping at the moment. Specifically, the "uthash" library by
 *  Troy D. Hanson is the one who provides the whole hash table functionality.
 *
 *  It is also worth noting that, once the symbol table is created, its
 *  initial contents are:
 *
 *    - The built-in commands in common/commands.h
 *    - The math constants in common/math_constants.h
 *    - The math functions in common/math_functions.h
 *
 *  This will allow telling those elements apart from variables' identifiers,
 *  as they are all alphanumeric strings.
