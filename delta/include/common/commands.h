 * @details
 *  This file contains the utilities through which delta implements its
 *  built-in commands.
 *
 *  A command is a prefixed function, which may take 0 or 1 arguments (more
 *  specifically, a string). The currently supported commands are:
 *
 *    - help(): shows generic help about delta.
 *    - dhelp(section): shows detailed help about the specified delta section.
 *
 *    - from(library_path): searches for a dynamic library and loads it, if it
 *                          is not yet, while also setting it as the last
 *                          opened dynamic library. 
 *    - import(function): loads a newly specified math function from the last
 *                        opened dynamic library; the function must follow the
 *                        "math_functions/d_dec_function" prototype.
 *
 *    - load(file): opens a file which contains statements written in the
 *                  delta's language; they are all executed as they are read.
 *
 *    - ws(): shows the current workspace; that is, shows the symbol table.
 *    - wcs(): clears all registered variables in the current workspace.
 *
 *    - quit(): exits delta.
