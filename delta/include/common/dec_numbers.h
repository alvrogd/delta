 * @details
 *  This file contains the utilities on which delta relies to represent
 *  base 10 numbers. These may be both integer and floating point.
 *
 *  It is true that all base 10 numbers could be represent using just a single
 *  floating data type. However, delta is intented to be a calculator, and in
 *  order to do it properly, it should avoid any C precision related errors
 *  while only integer arithmetic is required by the user.
