 * @brief This is the syntantic and semantic analyzer that delta will use.
 *
 * @details
 *  This is de definition of the syntactic & semantic analyzer that delta will
 *  use through the interpretation process. The analyzer relies on bison, a
 *  tool that generates parsers that convert an annotated context-free grammar
 *  into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR(1)
 *  parser tables.
 *
 *  Its duty is to parse the lexical components that are recognized by the
 *  lexical analyzer, in order to recognize valid sentences of delta's
 *  language that may be executed. As the lexical analyzer is implemented
 *  using flex, the integration between these analyzers will follow standard
 *  procedures covered in many online resources (there is an example below).
 *
 *  TODO which sentences are valid?
 *
 * @see https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
