 *
 * @brief This is the lexical analyzer that delta will use.
 *
 * @details
 *  This is the definition of the lexical analyzer that delta will use 
 *  through the interpretation process. This analyzer relies on flex, a tool
 *  for generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text, which
 *  already includes its own I/O system.
 *
 *  Its duty is to read the contents given by the user, recognizing the
 *  lexical components that are present in it. The standard input source will
 *  be stdin, but the user can order the lexical analyzer to read a certain
 *  file at anytime.
 *
 *  As the lexical & semantic is implemented using Bison, the flex-bison
 *  interaction means that those lexical components will be defined in another
 *  bison-generated file, "lexical_components.h".
 *
 *  For some lexical components, it will be enough to just identify them
 *  through those lex. comp. definitions (i.e. a "==" has the same meaning
 *  wherever it may appear), whereas others, such as identifiers and literals,
 *  will be returned along with some additional attributes, as each specific
 *  lexeme in this categories has a different meaning:
 *
 *    - Identifiers will carry pointers to their entries in the symbol table.
 *      Identifiers may correspond to variables, math functions/constants, and
 *      built-in commands.
 *    
 *    - Base 10 numbers will carry a "struct d_dec_number" that represent
 *      them.
 *
 *    - Strings will carry a string that represent their quote-limited
 *      characters.
