 *
 * @brief This is the lexical analyzer that the delta compiler will use.
 *
 * @details
 *  This is the definition of the lexical analyzer that the delta compiler use
 *  during through the compilation process.
 *
 *  Its duty is to parse the contents given by the I/O system, recognizing
 *  the lexical components that are present in it. These are defined in
 *  lexical_components.h
 *
 *  For some lexical components, it will be enough to just identify them
 *  through those lex. comp. definitions (i.e. an "if" has the same meaning
 *  wherever it may appear), whereas others, such as identifiers and literals,
 *  will be returned along with some additional attributes:
 *
 *    - Both identifiers and literals will carry the lexemes (characters) that
 *      represent them in order to not lose their specific values.
 *    
 *    - Furthermore, identifiers have many additional metadata, such as their
 *      data type, first appearance... That is why they will also point to
 *      their corresponding symbol table's entries, which will already contain
 *      all that metadata, instead of replicating it.
 *
 *  Thus, a recognized lexical component will be presented as a struct
 *  d_lexical_component, which contains:
 *
 *    - The integer that represents the lexical component's category.
 *
 *    - A void * pointer to its attributes.
 *        - If the component is a literal, it is a char * to its lexeme.
 *        - If the component is an identifier, it is a
 *          struct d_symbol_table_entry *, which already contains the lexeme
 *          (see common/symbol_table.h).
