 *
 * @brief This is the lexical analyzer that the delta compiler will use.
 *
 * @details
 *  This is the definition of the lexical analyzer that the delta compiler use
 *  during through the compilation process.
 *
 *  Its duty is to parse the contents given by the I/O system, recognizing
 *  the lexical components that are present in it. These are defined in
 *  lexical_components.h
 *
 *  For some lexical components, it will be enough to just identify them
 *  through those lex. comp. definitions (i.e. an "if" has the same meaning
 *  wherever it may appear), whereas others, such as identifiers and literals,
 *  will be returned along with some additional attributes:
 *
 *    - Both identifiers and literals will carry the lexemes (characters) that
 *      represent them in order to not lose their specific values.
 *    
 *    - Furthermore, identifiers have many additional metadata, such as their
 *      data type, first appearance... That is why they will also point to
 *      their corresponding symbol table's entries, which will already contain
 *      all that metadata, instead of replicating it.
 *
 *  As you may see, this analyzer relies on flex, a tool for generating
 *  programs that perform pattern-matching on text.

/**
 * @brief The lexical analyzer destroys a lexical component that has
 *        previously created.
 *
 * @details
 *  The lexical analyzer frees any resources that may have allocated
 *  previously for a given lexical component, and for which it must take
 *  responsability, as some of them may carry attributes.
 *
 *  Specifically, according to the different types of lexical components that
 *  have attributes:
 *
 *    - Those that have an entry in the symbol table are already memory-
 *      -managed by it. That is:
 *
 *        - If actual scopes were supported, closing one would imply deleting
 *          all of its identifiers. They must not be deleted earlier, as an
 *          identifier can be referenced multiple times in the same scope. As
 *          of now, the "only scope" would be terminated when destroying the
 *          symbol table. In such event, all allocated memory to each present
 *          identifier will be freed.
 *
 *        - Keywords cannot be removed from the table until the input file
 *          parsing has ended. Therefore, they will also be destroyed by the
 *          symbol table in the previous circumstances.
 *
 *    - Regarding the other components that also have attributes, but no
 *      entry, these attributes have been reserved on purpose when recognizing
 *      the lex. comp. from the input file, so they will not be freed unless
 *      the consumer requests it.
 *
 * @param[in,out] lexical_component Pointer to the lexical component that will
 *                                  be freed.
 *
 * @return 0 if successful, any other value otherwise.
