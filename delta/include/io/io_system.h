 *  This utility allows reading a desired input file, character by character,
 *  therefore providing every utility that the lexical analyzer may require.
 *
 *  Its design follows the "sentinel buffer" method explained in the book
 *  "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred Aho et al.
