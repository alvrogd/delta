 * @brief This utility allows reading an input file, character by character.
 *
 * @details
 *  This utility allows reading the desired input file, character by
 *  character, in order to provide every utility that the delta's lexical
 *  analyzer may require to do its job. As of now, only one source file is
 *  supported.
 *
 *  This system's design follows the "sentinel buffer" method explained in the
 *  book "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred Aho et al.
